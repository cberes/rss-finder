# rss-finder

Simple utility to find and format an item in an RSS feed.

## Installation

Clone the repo. Use [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) to build the standalone JAR.

    $ lein uberjar

## Usage

Run the standalone JAR file.

    $ java -jar rss-finder-0.1.0-standalone.jar

You will need a configuration file. See the next section.

## Options

Rss-finder requires a configuration file. It uses [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) for the configuration file. The file must be located at `$HOME/.rss-finder/config.edn`.

These are the available options:
- `:rss-url` defines the URL of an RSS feed to parse
- `:rss-file` specifies the path to a local RSS file to parse
- `:title-regex` is used to pick the first item with a matching title. The regex is enclosed in `\b` classes
- `:description-regex` is used to select text from the item's description. It should define at least one capturing group (which will be used with the `:format-text` option)
- `:format-text` specifies a Java format string that is output if a matching RSS item is found. The capturing groups from the result of applying the `:description-regex` option are used as the arguments to format this text
- `:extra-output` sets extra text to print before the program exits

See the following section for an example configuration.

## Examples

This is an example configuration:

```clojure
{
  :rss-url "http://sabres.nhl.com/rss/news.xml"
  :title-regex "against"
  :description-regex "(.*?) +- +.+"
  :format-text "Tonight's game is in %s."
  :extra-output "Good luck!"
}
```

With the above configuration, the Buffalo Sabres' RSS feed would be read. The program would find the first item that contains the word "against." It would find a word following by at least one space, a dash, at least one space, and then any character.

For example, if the feed contained this item:

```xml
<item>
  <title>SABRES LOOK TO REBOUND AGAINST STRUGGLING CANUCKS</title>
  <link>
    <![CDATA[
    http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=791536&cmpid=rss-labarber

  <guid><![CDATA[ http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=791536 ]]></guid>
</item>
```

Then the program would output this text.

```
Tonight's game is in VANCOUVER.
Good luck!
```
